Exploring/Cleaning Data using SQLite3

Finding the 10 worst selling movies by revenue

SELECT original_title, revenue
  FROM Movie_Data
  ORDER BY revenue
  LIMIT 5;
  
Brings back:
original_title revenue
Halo Legends	1000000.0
A Hard Day's Night	1000549.0
Where the Wild Things Are	100086793.0
The Dark Knight	1001921825.0
Little Miss Sunshine	100523181.0

Noticed the revenue coloumn is being stored as a STRING data type which brings back false results 

So I test usuing the CAST function to change the data type to FLOAT so SQLite reads the entire numeric value in the revenue cell

SELECT original_title, revenue
  FROM Movie_Data
  ORDER BY CAST(revenue AS FLOAT)
  LIMIT 5;

Which brings back:
original_title	revenue
Boy	43.0
Death at a Funeral	46.0
Wanted	134.0
The Sum of All Fears	193.0
The Hunt for Red October	200.0

and by putting 'desc' after the CAST function we get the top 5 revenue movies which are:

original_title	revenue
Avatar	2781505847.0
Star Wars: The Force Awakens	2068178225.0
Titanic	1845034188.0
The Avengers	1519557910.0
Jurassic World	1513528810.0

Cross checking google searches these results are correct
